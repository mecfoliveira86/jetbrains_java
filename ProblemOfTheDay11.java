The cinema has n rows, each row consists of m seats (n and m do not exceed 20). The two-dimensional matrix stores the information on the sold tickets, number 1 means that the ticket for this place is already sold, the number 0 means that the place is available. You want to buy k tickets to the neighboring seats in the same row. Find whether it can be done.

Input data format

On the input, the program gets the number of n rows and m seats. Then, there are n lines, each containing m numbers (0 or 1) separated by spaces. The last line contains a number k.

Output data format

The program should output the number of the row with k consecutive available seats. If there are several rows with k available seats, output the first row with these seats. If there is no such a row, output the number 0.
